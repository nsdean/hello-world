I love cinema and I am teaching myself how to code in Python. So I'm combining
these two things to try and get more out of both. Most of the posts here will
likely be devoted to simple attempts at data vizualisation, rather than real
analytical insights of deep merit.

When not doing this, I run [*Nature Energy*](https://www.nature.com/natureenergy).
